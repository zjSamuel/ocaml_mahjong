# Demo

Here is the demo of libraries. We can run this demo to prove we can use the functions from dream to build our frontend-backend system to play mahjong.

The function of this demo is to accept post/get request to run our backend functions like draw and discard.

We build the frontend by writing HTML, later we might add js to write a "real frontend" or use something like that.
